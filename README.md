# Data-Science-Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).

#### The R portfolio is located [here](http://rpubs.com/uday04).

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

  - ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

     - __Python__ 
        - [Linear Regression Housing Prediction](https://github.com/UdayShankar04/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Linear%20Regression_HousePrediction.ipynb):Analysing and building a Prediction model using linear Regression of USA Housing Price dataset. 
        - [Pima Indian Diabetes Study](https://github.com/UdayShankar04/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Pima%20Indian%20Diabetes%20Study.ipynb): The objective of this project is to apply exploratory analysis and regression techniques to identify which features affect  the most.
        
       - __R__
        - [Data Mining & Predictive Analysis on Airlines Performance](http://rpubs.com/uday04/383232): Every day, approximately 2500 flights, operated by over 50 airlines, arrive or depart from a brazilian airport and are registered by the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC). ANAC provides that data, allowing us to analyse it in order to answer questions like: what airline has more delayed or canceled flights? What's the busiest airport in Brazil? A few os those insights are presented here:
        - [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](http://rpubs.com/uday04/381766) : Stack Overflow is the world’s largest online community for developers, and you have probably used it to find an answer to a programming question. The second chapter uses data from the annual Stack Overflow Developer Survey to practice predictive modeling and find which developers are more likely to work remotely.
        - [Predict fuel efficiency from a US Department of Energy dataset for real cars of today](http://rpubs.com/uday04/381749): The first step before you start modeling is to explore your data. In this course we’ll practice using tidyverse functions for exploratory data analysis. Start off this case study by examinig your data set and visualizing the distribution of fuel efficiency. The ggplot2 package, with functions like ggplot() and geom_histogram() are included in the tidyverse.
